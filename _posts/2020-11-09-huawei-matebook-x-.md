Huawei is the most prominent company facing an ongoing controversy (reference mentioned below) from the world's significant portions, which puts it in great worry. Soon, Huawei may face trouble because Samsung and other affiliated companies banned their working with Huawei, and now, according to South Korean's newspaper US is also imposing restrictions on the trade among Chinese companies. The US government's regulations also prohibit non--American companies from doing business with Chinese companies because they manufacture their final products based on US raw material. Richard Yu states that it may be the **absolute Kirin processor** because of the sanction imposed on it.

Huawei manufactured this model after I phone's MacBook while it is the third-generation computer that moves continuously and smoothly on the success path. It gets a great acknowledgment based on its smooth and refined design. For the up-gradation in technology, Huawei doesn't need to put significant effort because of its elegancy as a premium laptop.

It weighs even less than letterhead paper, which shows its compatibility with the current environment as in measurement it is only **2.2 pounds** with dual USB ports and a Head Jack. The lid's opening may fascinate you because of the 278ppi touch screen and fully RGB color array. The keyboard comprises **1.3 mm** travel but still unsatisfactory due to the inconvenient click at the plate's bottom. Simultaneously, the image quality of the webcam is always disappointed, and the angle is not adjustable at a short distance.

The company states that it is not the final hardware, and it is just for photography, but the processor and chips are compatible and comprise 14 nanometers, which is good enough. The wrong side of this technology is of no cooling system installed in it, and the chips go hot during overwork on it.

The speakers are developed in a partnership with Dolby to reduce the harmful impact out of it. Even the dummy laptop, which is not finalized, has a micro speaker, which hardly fills a room with sound. The Huawei Mate book X is available in two colors: silver and green. Overall, it is good enough, but some drawbacks are still present in it, which creates a decline in purchasing it.
