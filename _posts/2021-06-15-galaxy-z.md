The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip will be succeeded by a next-generation clamshell foldable, and there's hope this Z Flip 3 will be a major upgrade.

When we reviewed Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip, we did so with plenty of excitement. That model has been subsequently updated with 5G and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus, though retains the same physical design - it's just now faster. There are however, still shortcomings, like the small external display.

Will the Galaxy Z Flip 3 step things up? Here's everything we know about it so far.

If Samsung maintained its regular release schedule, then a Galaxy Z Flip 3 would have arrived a year after the original, which would have been around February 2021. That of course didn't happen.

Instead rumours suggest a folding device version of Galaxy Unpacked will reveal new Z Flip and Z Fold models on 3 August, replacing the company's traditional Note event - a device that we don't expect to see in 2021 at all, if ever again.

It's said the Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3 will then be made available on 27 August. Nothing has been confirmed as yet though.
