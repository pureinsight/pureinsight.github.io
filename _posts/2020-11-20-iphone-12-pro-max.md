iPhone 12 pro max shows great benevolence for the people facing lockdown because, before that, no one needs such a large screen phone with almost the same features available in its siblings. The large screen and better battery life is the most demanding and attractive feature of this model. I Phone 12 mini maybe looks acceptable to someone, but I Phone 12 pro max has such an attraction that no one resists themselves from buying it. 

It is beyond I Phone's former models' level because of its high-level performance, large screen, and an innovative or innovative **four-lens camera**. Whereas, the screen size may be annoying for someone, and the camera can be volatile.  While buying the mobile Phone, the first most crucial aspect you have to notice whether you need such a big-screen phone or not when the I Phone 12 pro already has a **6.1" screen**. You can sort and prioritize the model depending on their storage capacity, while the worth noting aspect is the price of I Phone 12 pro and pro max has almost the same price but change depending on the mode of purchase.

The Pro Max slices a striking figure close to the last couple of ages of iPhones. Enlivened to a limited extent by Apple's overhauled iPad Pro, the Pro Max is smooth and precise with level, treated steel edges that, while eye-getting, rush to get fingerprints. The new model's size is thinner than the former models, making it more attractive while the weight is a little more, but it doesn't create a fuss. The I Phone pro max is comfortable to carry the whole day, which is the most prominent aspect.

The **MagSafe** accessories are fully supported by it, and its **wireless charging puck** is notable among them. It provides ease in the life of most people and the source of attraction for them. It is not a suitable medium because the radiation creates out of it can affect the environment and a person's physical health. The researchers are still analyzing the extent to which it can create harm; if this rumor turns true and I Phone is planning to launch a more portable model, they must have to make a depth analysis to overcome the highlight issue.

The pro max's running and working capacity are **6 GB**, which is more than the pro's RAM, which is 4 GB. Pro Max RAM is the biggest of all non-pro models launched this year, but there is no significant performance difference, but RAM creates a difference. I Phone pro maxâ€™s camera also has the identical f/1.6 aperture because the smaller iPhone 12 Pro, which lets light hit the sensor, but there is a twist: The sensor's pixels are physically more significant; they capture even more light than on the smaller Pro phone. In daylight, you will not see much of a difference; this mostly means, in some cases, the camera won't automatically awaken Night Mode as frequently or that it doesn't have to last as long when it does. 

So wrapping up all the aspects, if you are a big screen phone person and want a good performance camera, then it will be best for you to buy and use it. The combination of better RAM, camera, and battery life makes you overlook all its negative aspects.
