Motorola is synonymous with offering quality products at an affordable price. If you buy a Motorola phone you know you'll be getting something that will last and get the job done well, but won't be worrying your wallet too much.

The epitome of this is its G10 phone. It comes in at only £129.99, packs a whole lot of phone for that remarkable price, and Carphone Warehouse are happy to help you get one.

You'd generally think that because the G10 is an entry-level phone that you'd be getting out of date software. But here we have another example of how Motorola has upped its game. With the G10 you get Android 11, the most up to date operating system available.

And also unlike so many other brands, Motorola tends to avoid any bloatware that'll clog the Android experience. You get a clean Android with a couple of additions that actually adds to the experience. We particularly like the gesture that uses chopping motion to turn on the light. Pretty neat.
