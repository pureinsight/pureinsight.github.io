Quick question: at $749 unlocked, is the HTC U Ultra overpriced? If you answered "yes", then this might be for you. The Taiwanese company is currently running a spring offer through its official online store for the US, and this lets you purchase the U Ultra for $150 less than usual.

So if you're interested in the device you can get it for $599. That's obviously still not cheap, but it is definitely a much better price point for the phablet. You do still have to live with its less-than-stellar battery life, though.

Anyway, there's a catch here, because to be able to buy the U Ultra for $599 you need a special promo code. The good news is that HTC is emailing those to people who have signed up for its promotional membership program called Team HTC. So if you haven't done that already, just go to this website and enroll into Team HTC, then wait for an email containing a unique promo code for $150 off the U Ultra. Then place your order and you're done.
