Are you looking for Huawei's new model, and you're intended to buy it? It is not as easy as it seems to be. Huawei launched its new model named **Huawei mate 40** series with different features and specifications from the other series model. Brand "Huawei" must need praise because of introducing new features and especially the most prominent one: they manufactured an android smartphone which is not compatible with the android apps. The overall rating of the mobile phone is quite good, but still, there are some reasons present on which you may withdraw from your plan of buying it.

You may look for a good camera phone, and yes, it fulfills these criteria. Despite getting cut off from Google, it still contains some dominating feature, and the camera is one of them. It comprises of **four-lens** which is placed on the back in space ring style and co-developed with Leica. All the lenses have their description, incorporating a **50-megapixel**, f/1.9 essential sensor, a **20-megapixel** f/1.8 super-wide cine camera, and a **12-megapixel**, f/3.4 periscope fax sensor with optical picture adjustment (OIS). It shows a magnificent result in daylight and makes a clear difference in lights, especially in the cloud's color. No matter from where the light is appearing, it shows a crisp color of sceneries.

At the same time it has a forward-facing camera comprises **13 megapixels**; f/2.4, which shows a great result but takes a couple of period for processing while filter applied, which is not acceptable and shows little disappointment.

While the US companies and their affiliations banned doing business with Huawei. As a result, Huawei can't get access to the most influencing apps. These apps are liked by a significant proportion of people living in Europe, and the unavailability of those apps will put the basis on the decline. Huawei offers its app, while some apps such as Disney+, Tinder, and Facebook are still missing. At the same time, it may confuse you because one can also download those apps in **APKs format** through **Petal search**. 

A mystic silver color phone with a shining back is what you may want, and most importantly, it reflects and shows different colors while placing towards the light. The feature that attracts me most is its less slippery back than the matte 30 series, which is beneficial as the end doesn't look good with fingerprints, so they place a transparent case at the back.

The matte 30 series annoying feature is a cover-up by placing a physical rocker to handle the volume, which was not available in the former one. In matte 30 pros, you have to double-tap on the right side, and the pop-up volume setting appears, and you can't make surety that it will appear at the first time of clicking now overcome.

Undoubtedly, matte 40 pro is Huawei's freshest and most remarkable framework on-chip (SoC), the Kirin 9000. It's an octa-center framework with **8GB RAM**, a 24-center Mali G78 GPU, and an incorporated 5G modem. There are no prizes for speculating that this thing is enormous, quick with no defer when utilizing face open or the in-show unique mark sensor. With regards to using applications, everything coasts along.

In the end, there is still a gap present between the apps they have and android apps. At the same time, they claim their features close to apple but in reality, it still beyond them at the current time. Huawei also gets cut off from its major chip suppliers, which is why the only limited stock is available in the market. Matte 40 and Matte 40 pro will be available in four colors, while Pro+ will be available in only two colors, black, and silver.
