Huawei will soon bring its reasonably-priced (and specced) MediaPad T3 line of tablets to the market and we now have a better idea what screen sizes and prices to expect.

Well-known leakster Roland Quandt has shared a possible roadmap showing four MediaPad T3 models and the MediaPad M3 Lite 10.

The smallest tablet is the MediaPad T3 7 - it has a 7" 800x1280px display and will cost €129 for an 8GB Wi-Fi only variant - this makes it one of the most affordable compact slates to date.


Next up is the MediaPad T3 8 - it has the same screen resolution, only stretched to 8-inches. It will cost €219 for the Wi-Fi only model with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. An LTE model will be available for €20 more - €239.

The largest MediaPad T3 has a 10" screen, 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. It will go for €229 for the Wi-Fi only model and €279 for an LTE one.

Finally the MediaPad M3 Lite 10 will come with 3GB of RAM + 32GB of storage and cost €329 for the Wi-Fi only model and €379 for the LTE one.

Naturally the prices are subject to change before this group of tablets becomes official.
