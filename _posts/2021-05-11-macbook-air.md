It's no secret that we're big fans of Apple's new 2021 iMac redesign. The seven colourful hues mark a radical departure from years of dull, silvery-grey – and also serve as a delightful homage to brighter designs from Apple's past. We'd love to see the new design language hit other product lines – and it seems exactly that might happen soon.

The leak itself originated from Jon Prosser, who claimed in a YouTube video (below) that the same source who accurately leaked that the 2021 iMac would come in several colours has now claimed that Apple plans to introduce more "colours for average consumers".

Based on the "average consumers" comment, Prosser assumes that it's the cheaper MacBook Air that's in line for the new hues. But there is, of course, the possibility that Apple is planning a new MacBook entirely – perhaps rumours of a return for the 12-inch MacBook could soon become a reality? 

And if these new laptops pack the rumoured M2 chip, they could be super impressive inside and out. Indeed, the M1 chip has already wowed users and critics alike with its super-fast performance and efficiency. If you haven't got your hands on one yet, check out these awesome M1 MacBook deals.
